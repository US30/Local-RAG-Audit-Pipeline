How does the attention mechanism calculate the weights?,"The output is computed as a weighted sum, where the weights are calculated by dividing each dot product of the query with all keys by √dk and applying a softmax function. The formula for this calculation is:

softmax( QK T
√dk
)V",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions between the 'actual output' and the 'retrieval context'. This indicates that the model's response perfectly aligns with the input, resulting in a perfect faithfulness score!",1.0,"The score is 1.00 because the actual output directly addresses the question about how the attention mechanism calculates the weights, making it highly relevant."
What optimizer was used for training the Transformer?,"The Adam optimizer with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10 −9 was used for training the Transformer.",0.75,"The score is 0.75 because the actual output appears to be mostly faithful, but it contradicts itself by mentioning 'Adam optimizer', indicating some inaccuracy.",0.8,"The score is 0.80 because although the model provided a decent answer, it could have been more precise and directly addressed the question about the optimizer used for training the Transformer."
What is the primary advantage of the Transformer model over RNNs?,The Transformer model can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.,1.0,"Perfect score! The `actual output` perfectly aligns with the information presented in the 'retrieval context', with no contradictions found!",0.5,"The score is 0.50 because the actual output contains statements comparing training speed, which isn't relevant to answering what the primary advantage of Transformer over RNNs is."
