    "input": "What is the primary advantage of the Transformer model over RNNs?",
    "actual_output": "The Transformer model allows for significantly more parallelization during training and reduces the path length for dependencies in the network to a constant, unlike RNNs where dependencies decay with distance.",
    "context": ["Recurrent models generate a sequence of hidden states h_t, as a function of the previous hidden state h_{t-1} and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples."]
